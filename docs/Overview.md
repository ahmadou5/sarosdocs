**Saros DEX** is the liquidity hub on Solana, uniting traders, LPs, and builders in a single ecosystem built for sustainable growth. Our three liquidity engines address different market needs:

- Saros AMM provides continuous liquidity across all prices for simplicity and reliability

- Saros CLMM (coming soon) will enable concentrated liquidity for precision and higher yield potential

- Saros DLMM takes it further, allowing LPs to set dynamic price ranges and adapt instantly to market shifts, making pro-level capital efficiency accessible to everyone.

We approach this with a long-term mindset. The goal: more resilient liquidity, stronger project lifecycles, and a healthier ecosystem on Solana.
