# DLMM - Usage

Welcome to **Saros DLMM (Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker)** - the engine that powers the Internet Financial Market on Solana. Think of it as the facilitator for all of your trades behind the scenes.

nstead of using complicated order books like traditional **CEXs** or slippage-bearing models of AMMs, **Saros DLMM** runs on Liquidity Book technology - with pools of tokens provided by users (like you!). These pools make it fast and seamless for anyone to trade directly on Solana - no middlemen, just pure DeFi power.

## A New Kind of Liquidity Infrastructure

Liquidity is the foundation of financial markets. It ensures assets are tradable, capital can flow seamlessly, and markets remain functional. However, traditional financial systems are fragmented and inefficient. Each market - currencies, equities, or commodities - operates in isolation, tied to its own infrastructure, intermediaries, and rules. In these systems, liquidity is:

- Not open - access is gated, participation is permissioned, and value is captured by intermediaries.
- Not efficient - capital is fragmented, pricing is opaque, and value transfer is slow.
- Not resilient - liquidity often disappears during market stress, precisely when it’s needed most.

In contrast, the Internet Financial Market demands liquidity that is:

- Public - open to anyone, without gatekeepers.
- Composable - interoperable with any application or market logic.
- Resilient - always available, even in volatile conditions

To achieve this, we need a liquidity primitive that is:

- Automated - not provisioned manually by market makers
- Onchain - enabled by smart contracts, not intermediaries.
- Permissionless — open for anyone to use, supply, or build upon.
- Composable — designed to integrate seamlessly into diverse systems.

That primitive already exists today: Automated Market Makers (AMMs).

AMMs collapse human coordination across the entire market-making stack - pricing engine, order book, and matching logic - into code. They eliminate the need for institutional liquidity providers, centralized listings, and siloed market infrastructure.

By turning liquidity into protocol, and exchange into code, AMMs become a new kind of market infrastructure - where liquidity is always-on, onchain, and open to anyone.

With AMMs:

- Assets become tradable the moment they’re created.
- Applications plug into shared liquidity, instead of bootstrapping their own.
- Users connect directly to markets - no permission required.

This primitive transforms liquidity from a private service into a public good infrastructure. And when liquidity is treated as a public good, it becomes the foundation layer of the Internet Financial Market.

## Building Liquidity Infrastructure for the Internet Financial Market

At the core of Saros DLMM is a next-generation AMM primitive: Liquidity Book. It is designed to make liquidity capital-efficient, composable, and resilient by default across a wider range of assets, market conditions, and use cases.

Key Features of DLMM:

- Capital-efficient by design
  Liquidity is deployed across discrete price bins, dynamically optimized for volatility, slippage, and fee capture - enabling deeper markets with less capital.
- Composable by default
  Liquidity is accessible at the protocol level - it can be routed, abstracted, borrowed, and integrated into any application.
- Instant to launch
  Any asset can launch instantly - no listing process and no integration bottlenecks. Liquidity is programmable from day one.
- Built for volatility
  DLMM is engineered to hold up under pressure. It rebalances dynamically, preserves depth, and keeps markets functional when they’re needed most.

## Use Cases

Saros DLMM is a general-purpose liquidity engine designed to power programmable liquidity across a wide range of markets, including:

- Spot markets
- Lending
- Stablecoins
- Real-world assets (RWAs)
- Forex
- Derivatives and more

As more assets and applications integrate with Saros DLMM, the system compounds its value:

More assets → deeper liquidity → better execution → more yields (fees) → more liquidity providers (LPs) → more integrations.

This is how liquidity transformed from a fragmented service into shared, permissionless infrastructure that works for any asset, across any financial market.

And it starts with our liquidity book protocol.
