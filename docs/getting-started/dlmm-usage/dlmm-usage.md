# DLMM - Usage

Welcome to **Saros DLMM (Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker)** - the engine that powers the Internet Financial Market on Solana. Think of it as the facilitator for all of your trades behind the scenes.

nstead of using complicated order books like traditional **CEXs** or slippage-bearing models of AMMs, **Saros DLMM** runs on Liquidity Book technology - with pools of tokens provided by users (like you!). These pools make it fast and seamless for anyone to trade directly on Solana - no middlemen, just pure DeFi power.

## Use Cases

Saros DLMM is a general-purpose liquidity engine designed to power programmable liquidity across a wide range of markets, including:

- Spot markets
- Lending
- Stablecoins
- Real-world assets (RWAs)
- Forex
- Derivatives and more

As more assets and applications integrate with Saros DLMM, the system compounds its value:

More assets → deeper liquidity → better execution → more yields (fees) → more liquidity providers (LPs) → more integrations.

This is how liquidity transformed from a fragmented service into shared, permissionless infrastructure that works for any asset, across any financial market.

And it starts with our liquidity book protocol.
